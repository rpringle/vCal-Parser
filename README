vCal Parser was created specifically for local and state governments or anyone else who wishes to pass event information from a website entry to an individual calendar entry. This code will parse an event of your choosing, converting it into a proper vcalendar standards formatted file that can be imported into any vcal aware calendar software such as Outlook or Thunderbird.

IMPORTANT

This code is currently not usable and is a work in progress, though a php-savvy developer could easily use the coded provided as a good starting point for a rudimentary vcal parsing function.
