vCal Parser was created specifically for local and state governments or anyone else who wishes to pass event information from a website entry to an individual calendar entry. This code will parse an event of your choosing, converting it into a proper vcalendar standards formatted file that can be imported into any vcal aware calendar software such as Outlook or Thunderbird.

IMPORTANT

This code is currently not usable and is a work in progress, though a php-savvy developer could easily use the code provided as a good starting point for a rudimentary vcal parsing function.

TO DO LIST

1. Set up examples showing events passed by:

      A. Database query (MySQL)
      B. POST
      C. GET

2. Add code to check for each method and parse variables accordingly.

3. Expand list of vcalendar properties that vCal Parser can properly handle. Hopefully to include all.

4. Add code to create array from user-defined variables.

5. Add code to pass array to parsing function. (Note: pass array by definition, not by reference, as there will be no need to alter values outside of function.)

6. Properly define parser as function.
